Define JSX
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It's a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like code directly within your JavaScript files, making it easier to create and visualize UI components in React.

Explain about ECMA Script
ECMAScript is a scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International. JavaScript is the most well-known implementation of this standard, so new versions of ECMAScript (like ES6) bring new features and syntax to JavaScript.

Explain React.createElement()
React.createElement() is the function that JSX gets compiled down to by tools like Babel. It creates and returns a new React element, which is an object that describes a UI component or a DOM node.

Explain how to create React nodes with JSX
You create React nodes with JSX simply by writing HTML-like syntax directly in your JavaScript code. For instance, const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>; creates a React element representing an h1 heading.

Define how to render JSX to DOM
To render JSX to the DOM, you typically use ReactDOM.createRoot() to specify a container element in your HTML, and then call its render() method with your JSX component, like root.render(<MyApp />).

Explain how to use JavaScript expressions in JSX
You can embed any JavaScript expression within JSX by wrapping it in curly braces {}. This allows you to use variables, function calls, or arithmetic operations directly inside your markup, for example: <h1>{user.name}</h1>.

Explain how to use inline CSS in JSX
To apply inline styles in JSX, you use the style attribute with a JavaScript object. The keys of the object are camelCased CSS properties, and the values are the CSS values, like style={{ backgroundColor: 'red', fontSize: '12px' }}.
